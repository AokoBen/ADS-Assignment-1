# Malaria Prediction Web App


Malaria Prediction Web App
Malaria is a life-threatening disease worldwide as the leading cause of illness and death. In Kenya however, malaria lacks comprehensive documentation 
on its incidences at both the national and county levels. There is therefore, need to develop systems that capture national and regional trends of malaria incidence, 
infection, and outbreak, so as to provide tailored intervention for prevention, monitoring of possible outbreak of malaria, and provision of mitigative measures against 
devastating effects of malaria in Kenya.


## About Malaria Outbreak Prediction Model

This app is primed to assist public health workers to detect possibility of an early outbreak of malaria and suggest measures to mitigate the risks associated with an 
outbreak of the disease.

## App Architecture Framework

The malaria outbreak prediction app is web based and acts as an early warning system for occurrence of malaria. Malaria outbreak is determined by calculating threshold 
for likely outbreak of malaria based on three frameworks namely; climatic variables, mosquito vector population and reported malaria cases.


* i. Vector Based Framework
Malaria outbreak is attributed to plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium vivax parasites. This framework is based on meeting threshold for mosquito vector population as hosts for these disease-causing parasites. In a herd of mosquito, the number of the two species of mosquito as host for the plasmodium parasites determines the likelihood of a malaria outbreak.
